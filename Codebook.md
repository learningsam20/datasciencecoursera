## About Input

The input dataset includes the following files:

* 'README.txt'

* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector

* 'features.txt': List of all features to be analyzed

* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set with X variables

* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels with Y variables

* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set with X variables

* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels with Y variables

## About Output tidy dataset 

It consists of the data for mean of following data items

*act and subject indicating activity and subject variable, which is either mean and standard deviation measurement. These are the first two columns in the output tidy dataset viz. **aggregated data.txt***
